# Data-Classification

This dataset, the MAGIC gamma telescope dataset , is generated to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. The dataset consists of two classes; gammas (signal) and hadrons (background). There are 12332 gamma events and 6688 hadron events. You are required to use this dataset to apply different classification models such as Decision Trees, Naive Bayes Classifier, Random Forests, AdaBoost and KNearest Neighbor (K-NN). You are also required to tune the parameters of these models, and compare the performance of models with each other.
